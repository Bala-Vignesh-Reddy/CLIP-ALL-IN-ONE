  {
    "zero_shot_classification_imagery":
      "Because CLIP was trained on a diverse set of images and paired natural language
      descriptions, CLIP is able to generalize its understanding to new and unseen data and correctly classify both
      objective features *in the image* but also more abstract concepts *related to the image*. \n\nFeel free to experiment with more abstract concepts as
      well as more obvious objective image features with this app",
